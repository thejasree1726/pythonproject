RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR
In this random password generator, the user wiil be required to to enter how many letters,sysmbols and numbers user want in his password after which he'll be provided with a random password.
Here, we'll be using the 'random' module in python to create our project.
GAME-ROCK PAPER SCISSOR
In order to create a rock paper scissor game, we should be fully familiar with the rules of the game. The rules state that rock smashes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. 
So, rock wins over scissors, scissors win over paper and paper wins over rock. With the understanding of the rules, we can proceed to create the game.
In our code, this module will generate a random choice for the computer amongst rock, paper or scissors.
We have then defined a list of options (Rock, Paper, Scissors) that the user has to choose one from.
Next, we ask the user to input their choice using the input() function. The input that the user enters is stored in the user_choice variable. 
one of the above rules and conditions must come true and if none of these conditions are true, this means that the computer has won.
